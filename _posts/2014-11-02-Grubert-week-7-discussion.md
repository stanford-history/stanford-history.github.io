1) What is the distinction between a nonarchival DH project and an annotated archive? Should that delineation be clearer?
2) What makes good nonquantitative visualization? Many of the best “humanistic” visualizations are intended as art. Is that an important message for digital humanists? 
3) What makes narrative narrative in the context of a shared scholarly project? How does that definition of narrative inform what DH work might look like at its best?
