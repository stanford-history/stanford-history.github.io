#Contra Paul & Wayne, In Defense of E.D. as History + other thoughts

I would like to respond Paul's concerns regarding the unwieldly, disparate nature of Enchanting the Desert's presentation. He's right to point out that the 'thesis' listed on the site hardly makes an argument beyond "this is a worthwhile site". Yet I am prone to agree with Jenny, who makes the good point that this format is more productive for lay audiences, as it allows them to have an original, rather than interpreted experience of the material.

In short, I would point out that the project is not called "Explaning the Desert". The point is to present a whole array of narratives and perspectives, which clash and contrast or perhaps sublimate (as in Hegel, where dissonance resolves into a transcendent unity -- I found the metaphors of transposition and harmony rather apt). I am reminded of the historical principle articulated in the article about 'temporality' and 'spatiality', namely that historical argument cannot rely upon reductive modeling, because history in its essence tends to complicate and nuance. The historian is not an economist or a sociologist; it is neither law nor science. It is distinct from philosophy in that it will specify and detail, rather than generalize and abstract.

History seeks to re-present a past world. History, as a perfection of memory, points us beyond ourselves, to world we do not know and cannot inhabit. It is a communion with the deceased. In this way, it is enchantment per se. And I would defend the project on these grounds alone. Speaking as someone who has never been to the Grand Canyon, but has seen countless photographs, I think that Enchanting the Desert's virtue lay in its ability to contextualize, complicate, in a way complete my idea of this sublime object, by shrouding it with explanations and observations. In this way, I was able to better 'experience' a place I have never been.

Interestingly, this is exactly what Peabody wanted to accomplish with his representation of the canyon. Ironically, by re-presenting Peabody's work, we to some extent carry on his mission. In this way, the project remains within the history it wants to critically examine, namely the attempt to technologically mediate of the Canyon. But at the same time, the project exceeds such determination in two ways. First, it explains the social and artistic significance of the original landscape photography which produced these documents. In this way, it allows us to reflect upon the purpose and evolution of technology vis-a-vis our imagination of the west. Secondly, and more poignantly, the improvement of technology in this media presentation renders it, rather ironically, better equipped to articulate the ineffable grandeur of the object. By referring a single perspective back to the objective context in which it is encompassed (i.e., the topography), it clearly defines the limitations of such singular perspective. In this way, the structural destabilizes the phenomenological, by demonstrating its partial or fragmentary nature. In other words, it exposes us to the sublime.

I think this last point demonstrates an oversight in Drucker's (spatiality/temporality lady) critique of objectivity. I was somewhat convinced by her calls to replaced 'data' with 'capta', but I think in her final example (viz. the famous Cholera visual), she misses the mark. She wants to know about the personal experiences of individuals struggling with cholera, and is frustrated by such a reductive modeling. And I think she is right to demand these considerations, as they are indispensible to medicine as a social and cultural practice. But the objective consideration brings an essential component as well, and not only because it provides actionable insight. It expands our otherwise self-centered perspectives; it challenges us to look closer, at the fabric and texture of the world around us, for little things we might otherwise pay no heed, such as which water pump we are using.

#Discussion Questions

(1) What aspects of the history of the Grand Canyon presented in E.D. did you find most intriguing? What would you have liked to know more about?

(2) What did you think of Drucker's visualizations? Do you think she provides a viable "proof of concept", where visualization can remain true to the contingencies of historical interpretation, while still providing something more than could be accomplished in text?
