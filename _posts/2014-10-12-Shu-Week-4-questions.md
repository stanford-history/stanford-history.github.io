1. These tools seem to have high potential for the digital humanities, but I'm curious whether similar tools of machine learning and textual analysis have already been used for other fields such as translation or voice recognition?

2. Are there are any attempted guides or canons for the digital humanities? Or do people subscribe to 'screwing around'?

3. Although the 'infinite play of the world' seems like a great thing, what are some potential pitfalls to the 'screwing around' type of research? Perhaps there are different points in life where guides are needed and other points where exploration is appropriate? Should there be no guides or canons at all?
