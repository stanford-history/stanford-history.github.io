This week I looked at two digital archives: The [William F. Cody Archive](http://codyarchive.org/), the [French Revolution Digital Archive](http://frda.stanford.edu/), and the [Walt Whitman Archive](http://www.whitmanarchive.org/). Both archives illuminated a number of key issues related to digital history that were discussed in this weeks readings.

The [Conditions of Use](http://www.whitmanarchive.org/about/conditions.html) section of the Whitman Archive states that the project is licensed under a Creative Commons License, which, as the Cohen/Rosenzweig reading mentioned, is a solution that many digital historians use to protect their work while simultaneously allowing for noncommercial distribution and use by others. The Cody Archive is also published under a Creative Commons License, while the French Revolution Digital archive states that use of the content for "non-commercial purposes is free of charge, subject to compliance with applicable French legislation." This caveat touches upon the complexity of dealing with foreign documents, as was discussed in the Cohen/Rosenzweig reading.

The multimedia sections of these archives also reflect the nuances of copyright law. The Whitman Archive warns that those seeking to use the project's visual content "should write directly to the library holding the photograph." As mention in the Cohen/Rosenzweig  reading, images and other media are often subject to more stringent copyright enforcement. Several of the images in the Whitman Archive, however, are from the Library of Congress - meaning that that they are in the public domain. If a scholar wished to use an image of Whitman - but did not have the rights to use any of the private collection images used in the archive - these public domain images would be an excellent resource.

The multimedia section of the Whitman archive also contains an audio recording of Whitman's poem "Poets to Come." As stated in the Cohen/Rosenzweig reading, although recordings are protected by copyright law, scholars are free to record the music themselves as long as the music or work is in the public domain. Just as the authors of the reading produced their own version of "La Marseillaise" for a project, the Whitman Archive makes use of a recording produced in 2012 specifically for another Whitman digital project. Its inclusion in the Whitman archive reflects the number of creative solutions used by digital historians to work around the problems presented by copyright law.
