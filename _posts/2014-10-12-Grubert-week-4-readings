1) Particularly with something slightly black-boxy like topic modeling, what kinds of data and results do scholars have an obligation to publish or make available so that other scholars can evaluate their claims?
2) I’ve been immediately on board with a lot of the comments that topic modeling is low-barrier enough to potentially produce problematically nonexpert use of topic modeling on texts—but is that actually a problem, especially in an interpretive tradition? What kinds of “wrong” inferences could people make that are so problematic that would enter the discourse without appropriate challenge? (Perhaps using too few topics?)
3) For historical questions, are stopwords likely to be generally useful?
