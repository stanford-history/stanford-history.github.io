1. How might historians deal with "messy" data that cannot be corrected using simple data refinement techniques, such as implausible, ambiguous, or missing data? In instances that require judgement calls on the part of the historian, what guiding principles might help historians work around the "messiness"?

2. Could the use of data analysis as a historical tool lead historians away from historical topics / issues with "messier" data sets? Could the convenience of clean data sets steer historians away from data that might reveal a more nuanced or complex historical picture? 

3. Considering the rapid rate at which digital technologies become obsolete, could the trend towards digital history have a negative effect on the resources available to future historians? How might historians leverage either digital or traditional media to ensure that their work will be available years, decades, or possibly even centuries into the future?
