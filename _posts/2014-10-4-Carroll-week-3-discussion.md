1) Which organizations should take responsibility for the long-term preservation of digital materials?

2) Does data play an appropriate role in modern historical research? Are researchers too reliant on quantative evidence, or are they not reliant enough?

3) Is it useful to understand the history of the term "data"? Is deconstruction or close analysis of historical terminology useful?
