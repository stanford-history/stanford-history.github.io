# Week 5 Discussion

1. I'm curious, however, whether those connections such as weather correlating with nodes of people across Europe as a result of a Volcanic eruption could be just a matter of coincidence rather than something causation driven. Furthermore, I curious whether  insight into different people across Europe was because of Kindred Britain's visualization or was already known before that was made. In other words, did the network visualization bring out the insight or was vice versa?

2. “The insights of the humanist take years to accumulate; we have a feel for our time period and our people that numbers and graphs and maps simply do not capture, one that is born of long hours spent reading and thinking about the complicated textual and intellectual problems that the past presents to us.” This seems to be a criticism of digital humanities as whole. How do we use technology to show the greater nuance in history instead of using it as something to dangerously simplify something? What heuristics can we use to tell whether we're doing one or the other?

3. It seems like for many of the methods used in digital humanities stem from methods used in statistics and computer science. For deep and accurate digital humanities study, should there be a prerequisite  deep understanding of the mathematical concepts behind methods being used? Should the digital humanist be just as well versed in mathematics as she is in the humanities in order to truly understand the type of work being done?
