1. Online digital history projects allow historians to reach a much wider audience. Given the potential for their work to reach a more broad and non-academic audience, to what extent should historians take a non-academic audience into consideration when designing / implementing the project?

2. How might digital historians take advantage of the information revealed by studies into "digitizations most wanted"? Is it in the interest of historians to include digital content that is "share-worthy" in a social media context? What are the tradeoffs between accessibility / possible interest and the complexity / nuance of a historical project?

3. How might digital history affect the work being done in more traditional historical research? Could a focus on networks, quantitative analysis, and visualization become more relevant in historical papers / books, or are these likely to remain more squarely in the domain of digital historians?
