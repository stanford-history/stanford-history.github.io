## Week 7

It's easy to simply say yes with a prompt like this( and in the context of the class). Ostensibly,  hypertext can show the connections between events around the same time; interactivity can enable us to better understand or dive deep into a historical concept that is harder to grapple with via pure text.

However, I think it's important to keep in mind the dangers or potential pitfalls of hypertext and interactivity that technology may enable in our communication. First, the idea of linear structure and its aberrance. Historical narratives are narratives for a reason —there are often common threads that run within the stories we tell. Yes, hypertext can perhaps illuminate events  by showing us the many complexities that are within parts of the historical narrative. We can choose and explore different paths of a narrative.   Hypertext can even be used to compare different narrative perspectives at similar points of a narrative.
But this may ultimately take away from the fundamental thesis that a historical narrative puts forth. A coherent narrative no longer becomes a singular entity or idea of itself, but is threatened to become a database or amorphous glop of information that the reader may  be overwhelmed with. The idea of authorship dwindles as every essay hyperlinks to different thoughts that detract and even distract from the core ideas and distinctive style of authors. This could become more philosophical as one weighs the importance of an author of a work versus just ideas derived by others. Although some argue that ideas are never wholly original and that we build off of each other, shouldn't there still be a sense of original thought and individual craftsmenship?

Interactivity also sounds great. But there is the danger of having too much interactivity, too much exploring or aimlessly navigating instead of having a coherent idea that a historical narrative could put forth to guide the reader. There risks, again, distraction from the core argument of a narrative for more secondary means to presumably entice the reader. Interactivity will have to be seen as a way to help the reader understand a core argument and not just something that looks cool when put in with text.

Paul Carroll actually says it perfectly: “ Anyway, interactivity seems to leave us in danger of incoherency. We let our readers explore a world that we’ve created for them, but we don’t give them a map. This does not feel like an easy tool to use well.”

I still would be bullish on hypertext and interactivity for the future of presenting historical ideas. The important thing will be to be aware of the potential pitfalls and make sure that digital narratives aren't at the expense of the narrative itself.
