On copyright: Have copyright and other forms of IP protection influenced the inquiry and culture of history as a discipline?

On digital documents in general: This week's readings focused a lot on what gets put on the Internet by historians. How does something become a historical document? Now that the Internet has been around for a while, how does history as a discipline view "born digital" records?

On popularity: Do historians welcome traffic to their work or study documents? Terras comments a bit about various archival documents that have gone essentially viral. Is that seen as a good thing by the field at large? Is it still a debate?
