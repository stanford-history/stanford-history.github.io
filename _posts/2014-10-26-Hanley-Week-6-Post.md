#Defining the Social Relation

When considering large-scale historical processes -- whether industrial (as in Silicon Valley) or academic (as in the Republic of Letters) -- one central question of historical interpretation is that of the Great Man vs. the Structure. The first approach focuses on individual geniuses -- such as Steve Jobs, or Isaac Newton -- and the ways that they were about to single-handedly shape the course of events. The second approach looks instead at an entire milieu, the context or ‘conditions of possibility’ which first of all allowed such geniuses to emerge.

It seems that network analysis is implicitly inclined to the latter, as it reduces the individual to a node in a relational graph, literally stripping him/her of any identity beyond that established in relation to others. I am personally more convinced by a structural approach, so the whole premise of network analysis is already somewhat appealing to me.

However, it is at the same time imperative that we consider what modality of relationship can find expression in quantitative-mathematical analysis. This is of course a recurring theme of our seminar: both the limits, and the capacities, of old-school qualitative research on the one hand, and newfangled digital methods on the other. But I think that the distinction is brought to a head with something like the analysis of relationships.

This is because the quality and modality of relationship is an essential component of most, if not all, social and cultural history. A network graph simply draws a line between two points; but what is meant by that line? Adequately defining this connection of agents is no marginal feat. According to Marx, the whole history of human society is expressed in the ‘relations of production’.

Of course, it would be ridiculous to let the lack of a rigorous social theory prevent us from trying our hand with network visualization. But I think that our interpretation of these graphs must be just as qualitative and contextual as we saw with LDA.

I will give two examples, in order to better explain what I mean.

First, regarding the Silicon Valley reading. Namely, I’d like to take issue with the claim made at the very end of the article, that “In studying Silicon Valley's networks, we are probing its deepest and most enduring source of vitality, which will determine whether its world-dominating position can survive very far into the twenty-first century.” I agree that an essential component of Silicon Valley’s success has been its inherently fluid labor markets, its open flows of knowledge and creativity. I enjoyed this article, think its subject matter is fascinating, and would like to read more scholarship of this type.

However, we must recognize the hard limits to what these methods can reveal. I think they are very effective at supporting or complicating a given thesis, but they are wholly incapable of formulating, even implicitly, a paradigm for the interpretation of social relations. Bringing the issue back to Marx’s comparison of relations of production to the means of production, however, it seems that while network visualization can characterize a given social structure as more or less stratified or hierarchical, it cannot tell us how this hierarchy manages to support and sustain itself, as well as who benefits from or is exploited by it. 

My second example comes from my trial with Gephi, where I looked at a network of jazz musicians, based on collaborative recordings, gathered by Physicists. In their article, they do a lot of cool quantitative analysis (I, on the other hand, was limited to a fruitless buttonmashing), and show determinate similarities between these networks and ones demonstrated in email chains. This conclusion leads the authors to speculate a general theory, or formula, for social structures.

Without dismissing the possibility of such a formula, I think the whole premise is a bit of a slippery slope. It is especially ironic that they would suggest an attempt at some rote formulation of social structures, after studying one of the most eccentric, innovative and spontaneous communities of all time -- jazz musicians. I am a jazz musician, and am very interested in their history. I am interested in the way that jazz at its essence seems to defy history, by pushing for ever novel reformations of what has come before. By the same token, I am interested in the ways that jazz lets players who have never met come together and jam, construct a common space in which each can express their particular voice. These peculiar qualities are then, of course, compounded with and colored by the particular location of jazz in 20th century America, with all the cultural and social tendencies this implies.

In short, I am deeply suspicious that an analysis of nodes and edges can ever express what is truly special about a form like jazz. In fact, it seems designed precisely to abstract from and reduce away these special qualities. In this way, it can definitely obstruct our attempt to qualify and define the social relation.


#Discussion Questions

1. What are some networks in the Silicon Valley that you’d like to see graphed?
2. How do digital social media -- Twitter, Facebook, et al -- change the game in terms of social network analysis? Obviously they are literally designed to make it easier -- but how do we complicate the data that they are giving us?
