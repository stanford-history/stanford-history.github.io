1) What are the pitfalls of spatial history? What goes unsaid or undiscussed in this format?
2) Does a map in itself constitute evidence? How does one support claims that are derived primarily from mapping (especially when initially derived independently of other evidence)?
3) Are automated methods for extracting place names and spatially relevant phrases adequate at this point? How do references to “over there” or “back home” get incorporated in analyses of place and space?
