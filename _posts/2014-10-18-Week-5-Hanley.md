title: Maps of Berlin and London, ~1850 vs ~2010

Hi all. You can access my 'artefacts' at the following link:

I'd like to point out a few things. First, both contemporary metro areas extend far beyond the areas given in the map (just look at all that gray!). Now, is this because that development is all recent (and thus more like a suburb), or did it exist previously, just outside the bounds of the city proper (and thus a town in its own right)? Because they are Old World cities, I am inclined to believe the latter (in fact, I know that Berlin doesn't really become a city until the 18th century, and stitches together several smaller towns into what is today its many, rather large neighborhoods).

In the big picture, this raises the question of what exactly constitutes "The City". Here are at least two ways we could attempt a definition. We could take a set of physio-economic parameters -- traffic flow (aggregated into commuter routine), networks of industry and commerce (aggregated into supply chains). Yet there are also cultural and aesthetic considerations -- I am think of the Literary Lab's 'affective mapping' of London through novel analysis.

More specifically, we might ask what exactly is meant by the white space. In other words: are they part of the map -- signifying the emptiness or unimportance of this space -- or do they simply fall outside what the cartographer set out to illustrate?

Let's turn to the documents. 

Looking at East London, we see that the current "Places" logged into Google Earth cling to black spaces on the map. This suggests that the city as defined in the original map is simply a 'regressed' version of the contemporary. In other words, the older map seems to predict the trajectory of development.

Looking at Berlin Places we see this does not hold. There is a massive cluster in the eastern whitespace, the town/neighborhood Friedrichshain. It's unclear whether Friedrichshain was at this point technially a part of Berlin, or to what extent it even existed. However, the map does tell us that it was not considered an important part of the city. Today, it has a lion's share of the most famed dance clubs, which in a city synonymous with EDM, means a lot.

Of course, this has a lot to do with the fact that the size, population, and importance of Berlin exploded in the 19th c., when it became both an industrial hub, and more importantly the capital of the newly formed German Empire. Then, in the 20th c. it was divided into two cities, the east half of which extended only as far as Friedrichshain, and thus made this its center.

Considering that, it is not venturing much to hypothesize that Berlin's development should show more volatility than that of London, which was not subject to fascist takeover or foreign administration.

As a final note, I thought it was interesting to see Mosques and Wikipedia sites in Berlin. Germany opened its doors to Turkey in the post-war period to provide the labor necessary for the Wirtschaftswunder ("Economic Miracle"). Today, the national dish is DÃ¶ner Kebab. However, the areas with Mosques all fall outside the center of the city. It is the reverse for Wikipedia sites (which should correspond to sites with established historical significance); they all fall within a short radius around the heart of the city (and mostly in the west). By these two simple metrics, we can already build some evidence of a clear "downtown" and "ethnic periphery".

My frustration is only that, so far, playing around with these maps hasn't told me much I didn't already know.
