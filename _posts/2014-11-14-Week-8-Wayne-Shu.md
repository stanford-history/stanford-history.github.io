Thoughts on Digital History


We've gone over a lot of different techniques used in Digital History over the course.  It was interesting seeing how techniques were being used to try and express history in a different way. 
From exploring different archives to playing around with  tools, the course showcased how different digital techniques were being applied to the humanities. Readings and live demos immersed us into the what digital history meant and what its potential results and current shortcomings  contained. 

I must say that I envision digital history having a paradigm shift when virtual reality comes to the forefront of learning. 
Imagine immersing someone in the sounds and sights of a historical place constructed through software or the ability to manipulate maps with fingers in order to better understand what's going on. On the computers currently, however, we have powerful analytical techniques that apply statistical methods to find insight â€” which can exciting but isn't, I believe, as ground breaking because something is just being added; nothing new has fundamentally been created. 

Digital History will play a role in how history is analyzed and interpreted. The question is how large of a role though. If it can fundamentally shift the way we view and understand history, then it will surely be of canonical importance. However, if digital history  limits itself  to adding visualizations or analyzing words, the extent of how this will greatly enhance history is questionable. This is because most of these methods come as post-hoc justifications of observations already understood in history. They come as secondary information rather than primary observations that leads us to important discoveries. 

Digital history falls short in the technical rigor of some of its methods. If people don't understand how some algorithm works and what assumptions it uses, it'll be hard to tell how accurate data is given some set of assumptions in the algorithm that may have biased it. Another example is if one is trying to create this new digital experience: without technical know-how, I think it's hard to make a vision become a concrete reality. And instead of using the technically necessary elements to build something, a compromise is made not for artistic merit but for lack of knowledge. This hampers the process of innovation; digital humanists should have knowledge of both the technical and the abstract side of things. 

Anyway, the class was fun. I wish we had spent more time learning about the History of Silicon Valley. But surveying the current state of Digital History exposed me to things I probably never would've learned about. It's been a valuable class; now, it's time to buckle down for the project.
