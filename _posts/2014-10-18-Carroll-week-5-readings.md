Let me start off with a cool historical map. The map is probably more interesting than anything I'm going to write in my post, so I want to get it in up-front.

This, as you've probably gathered, is a map of Denver. Denver is my hometown, if you're curious why I chose it. I like this image because it seems somehow beautiful: the Denver of the nineteenth-century imposed on top of the highways of today. I noticed that many of the nineteenth-century street names have remained the same. 6th Avenue apparently used to have the much more colorful name "Grand Army of the Republic Highway." Which I will insist on calling it from now on.

But beyond such factoids, I wonder what there is to be learned from this overlay that couldn't be learned by looking at the original map. In this case, very little, if anything.

I'm trying to think of situations in which map overlays could generate interesting historical results. Right now, all I can come up with is, maybe if you overlayed historical maps on top of topograpical ones, you could have some insight into the geography of the region that you're studying?  But that seems unconvincing to me. I would love to see an example of two maps overlayed on top of each other in such a way as to reveal a surprising historical truth.

Generally speaking, I think that spatial history might be a useful tool in studying Silicon Valley. One theme in our readings has been suburbanization and the exodus of industry from downtown areas. I think it would be possible to create a spatial representation of this transformation, with a graphic that looked something like [this](http://lincolnmullen.com/projects/slavery/). You could toggle through time and examine how population density shifted to the suburbs. Maybe it would also be possible to track the flow of capital south, by examining corporate tax returns?

As for the usefulness of analyzing historical events spatially, I think this should be clear. Of course it's useful to analyze historical events spatially. Space helps define how people interact with each other. If the discipline of history were to ignore space, then, as Richard White memorably phrases it, we would be pretending that history "took place on the head of a pin," which would be silly. So the fact that computers can help us to generate better maps and visualizations will be deeply useful to the next generation of historians. I think even the staunchest opponents of digital humanities would have to concede that computers have a role to play here, if only in plotting coordinates more accurately than a human ever could.
