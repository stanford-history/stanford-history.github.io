1) Thinking along the lines of “What data can’t convey”— how do DH tools shape the questions historians ask? And in general, does a transition from scarce information to abundant information change what history is? 
2) How does the existence of DH and digital records more generally impact the time lag between present and history?
3) Thinking about the line in Rosenburg that “My graduate school friends called it ‘the dissertation machine’”—what types of analysis are novel right now? Frequency and authorship analyses seem to be increasingly easy to the point of not meriting publication—is that true? If so, what is the next big thing in DH?
4) How does a field transition from nonstatistical to statistical? That is, specifically, how do analyses and trust in their relevance change as a field moves toward a more quantifiable and/or quantified paradigm? What fields have preceded history in this change, and are there lessons? Is history going that way?
