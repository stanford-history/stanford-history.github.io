The proliferation of computer technology in the last half century has caused some pretty radical transformations in the production and distribution of knowledge. History as a science cannot afford to ignore the consequences and opportunities of such a fact. In this way I would compare the emergence of computer technology in the 21st century to that of the telescope and microscope in the 1600s. Those devices opened entirely new domains for questioning, a seeming infinity of ever larger and ever smaller components demanding observation and description.

And yet, it is uncertain that history is well suited for the task. It is obvious that the new tools will apply to the practice of history, but we have only vague notions of how. Accordingly, I offer the following three categories to define the domains and tasks of digital history: sources; methods; worlds.

---------------------------------------------------------

(1) SOURCES. Information technology captures the visual, textual, and sonic content of a material. In this way, it is naturally suited to serve as a historical archive. However, the constant search for a more encompassing, more efficient storage framework requires first of all a revolution in the ‘means of preservation’ for existing archives. The rapid development of this technology is thus a double-edged sword, requiring as it does the migration of antiquated data sets into new protocols.

As a second consideration, there is the issue that the great storehouses of data regard it as a capital asset -- I am thinking specifically of financial institutions, intelligence agencies, and social media. Their treatment, storage, use and distribution of data will proceed from their own, immediate interests, rather than the interests of historical inquiry. Moreover, access to this data is a highly political issue, raising questions of authority and ownership.

---------------------------------------------------------

(2) METHODS. The dynamic quality of this new archival material suggests new techniques of investigation and composition. Perhaps first among these are techniques relating to the analysis and visualization of quantitative information. In this domain, history is actually behind the social sciences, e.g. economics and political science. Academics in these fields have established sensible conventions for the use of data in research and argument. I think historians would do well to learn from the experience and insights of these more seasoned digital fields.

At the same time, though, history should not relinquish its distinctive mode of inquiry. History, I would argue, is not a social science, in that it does not seek out determinate causal linkages, or objective and actionable truths. History involves attention to detail -- or put more crudely, an obsession with trivia -- that severely complicates any attempt to give a transcendent, universal account of a phenomenon. In this way, I support history’s tendency to complicate data (rendering it as ‘capta’, as Johanna Drucker recommends).

---------------------------------------------------------

(3) WORLDS. The task of history is to reconstruct past worlds. Thus I cannot omit a consideration of historical projects that attempt this reconstruction more directly in the realm of cyberspace. Here is by far the most creative opportunity of digital history, one we saw in “Enchanting the Desert” or “Los Angeles and the Problem of Urban Historical Knowledge”. It is also probably the most difficult. This goes beyond the storage and organization of digital materials, beyond even their analysis and visualization, to their curation and articulation as a whole world of meaning and activity. Because worlds encompass a whole array of meanings and activities, the linkages which compose them are sprawling and nonlinear. In this way, I believe that the hyperlink structure of the web is perfect for building multimedia spaces for readers to explore.

---------------------------------------------------------

As a final note, I would like to highlight that in each of these three categories, the problem of data serves as a nexus, linking the discipline of history to a range of other crafts and concerns. In the first, the historian must converse with (or become) both archivist and activist. In the second, the historian must reach across the academic aisle and discourse with economists, political scientists, and perhaps others. Finally, in the construction of cyberworlds, the historian should draw upon and support the efforts of journalists, tourist guide books, and museum curators.
