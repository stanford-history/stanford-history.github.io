2. Is there anyway to tell whether data is being used more as just a rhetorical device as opposed to pure evidence? 

3. With cyberwarfare being just as important as nuclear warfare and especially with the revelations of from Snowden,
has the government been just as invested in Silicon Valley for national security as before?
