1. Given that Spatial History has a more stable grounding than some of the other methods we've considered (looking at you, topic modeling), might we conjecture the potential for an established vocabulary in considering spatial-historical questions -- whether urban, rural, economic, cultural, or otherwise?

2. As a corollary, are geographic information systems more consisent over time than other data systems? If so, they might represent a very worthwhile field for archival work. 

3. I am interested in the mental maps of a city that inhabitants generate dynamically and for specific purposes (I thought the Ethington project on Urban Space was really cool). However, cognitive maps rarely align to geocoded distances and locations. Can we think of ways to map out and visualize these diverse perspectives of a city?
