This week's readings on topic modeling seemed very, well, topical to me, so I'm pretty excited to discuss it.

The data set that I'm working with for this project is a collection of all the New York Times articles relating to Silicon Valley. There are about 11,000 of them, dating back to the mid-1970s. Obviously, I'm not going to read them all in the next seven weeks, so the computer is going to have to help me out. Topic modelling, according to Ted Underwood, "gives us a way to infer the latent structure behind a collection of documents." Miriam Posner says that "topic modeling is generally very useful for, say, learning about change over time." I need to investigate how the New York Times' discussion of Silicon Valley changes over time--how different topics relating to Silicon Valley fade in and out of discussion. Topic modeling might be perfect for that.

The basic assumption behind topic modeling seems to be that "documents are produced by discourses rather than authors." If I were analyzing novels, this assumption would make me nervous; but since I'm analyzing news, I think it might hold true.

To me, topic modeling seems like a useful trick for any historian who needs to find patterns in a large corpus of data. But I think it's important to point out, as the readings do many times, that topic modeling doesn't really find patterns at all. Rather, it points to the existence of clusters of words which might consitute a pattern. Topic modeling seems like a great tool for explanation, but not a great piece of evidence in a journal article. I'm looking forward to using it to generate research hypotheses, but I'm not sure if I can actually incorporate it directly into my final project. THis is a question that I'd like to discuss, actually, with Jason and the group.
