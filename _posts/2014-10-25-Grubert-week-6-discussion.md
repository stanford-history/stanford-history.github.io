1) A few readings called on historians to write their own algorithms. Should history majors / grad students be exposed to programming and DH as part of a basic history curriculum?
2) Most techniques like SNA are useful simplifications. Does something like weighting, multimodality, or better directional edge making need to develop before SNA is useful in history?
3) What responsibility do quantitative scholars have to put numbers into intuitive terms? What problems does providing readers with intuition introduce?
