1) We've talked a lot about how the digital age is going to change history, but the Snow Crash project made me wonder, how could the digital age change how journalism is presented? How can multimedia change how we tell stories?

2) Johanna Drucker argues that data should be visualized in a way that reveals "ambiguity and complexity." Doesn't this run the risk of making visualizations much more difficult to understand? Her sample visualization seemed almost unreadable to me. Where do we draw the line between simplicity and subtlety?

3) How much information should be packed into a visualization? Is it advisable for a visualization to contain multiple "thesis statements"--to be advancing multiple arguments at once? Where should we draw the line between information density in a visualization and visualization clarity?
