1) If Sturgeon's thesis is correct, and Silicon Valley played a critical role in the development of radio, then why have these contributions been forgotten? Why is Silicon Valley unaware of its ancestral ties to radio?

2) What is the ideal length of a copyright? Should copyright laws for photos be different than copyright laws for books, or recorded sound, or musical scores, just to name a few examples?

3) The copyright article argues that "we should focus more on getting others to pay attention to what we have to say rather than on ensuring that the proper individual gets the proper credit." Given that one's career as a historian depends on receiving "proper credit," is this claim true? How vigorously should historians defend their claim to their research?
