1) Can the output of a MALLET analysis be evidence for a particular historical position? Or is evidence too strong of a word?

2) What do the words in a topic have in common, or not have in common? How should we interpret these clusters of words? Is it fair to label them with some sort of overarching category, as Cameron Blevins does in "Topic Modeling Martha Ballard's Diary"?

3) What is an example of a large corpus of documents on which topic modeling would fail? By fail I mean, "not tell us anything interesting," or "the topics are just random words."
