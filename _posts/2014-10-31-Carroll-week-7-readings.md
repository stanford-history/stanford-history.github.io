First of all, I just want to say, if anyone here didn't check out Snow Fall as one of their sample projects...definitely do that. Like, even if it weren't assigned, I would recommend it. Really fascinating project that may have changed the way I think of journalism and what it is capable of.

On to the prompt. Yes, I think hypertext and interactivity can help us to construct more effective historical narratives. Snow Fall is an excellent example of how multimedia can help us understand a story, and history is all about telling stories. So yes, there's potential here. And yet I wonder if historians are managing it very well? 

The principal danger of interactivity, as I see it, is that it can obscure a thesis statement. Enchanting the Desert is very interactive--lots of opportunties to "dig deeper" into a person or photograph that I find interesting--but does it have a thesis? When I was navigating it, I felt as though I was meant to come to my own conclusions, thesis be damned. The website felt like more of a playground than a guided tour. But then I found this on the "Writing" page: "The proper reading of a landscape requires that one be aware of both the spatial context of what one is looking at--its relevance to the broader world--as well as the particulars of the human histories in the places that constitute the landscape scene." Is this really a thesis? To me it seems more like a justification for the website--a reason why the website ought to exist--rather than an argument that the website is trying to make. Just so we're clear: I *want* the website to have a thesis. Without one, I felt like I didn't know how I was supposed to navigate the project, what I was supposed to be gleaning from it. I felt like I was looking at pictures, and then, later, I was reading essays about the pictures. Each of the essays had an argument, but did they, cumulatively, have one? I'm not sure.

Anyway, interactivity seems to leave us in danger of incoherency. We let our readers explore a world that we've created for them, but we don't give them a map. This does not feel like an easy tool to use well.

Is it possible that all of these digital history projects are just too large? That they try to cram too much information into one webpage? Now that I think of it, it seems to me that all of the best visualizations/digital history projects that I've seen are very limited in scope. "Here's one awesome visualization that I've created that illustrates this one argument." You click on part of that one visualization and maybe some more information pops on the screen. One visualization, one thesis. Maybe just one webpage, without the need for a menu or navigation at the top? The scope of some of the DH projects is just immense--like after years of writing articles with strict word count restrictions, historians are luxuriating in the amount of information that they can fit into a website.

I'd love to hear what other people think about this.
