1. Can we extend digital history to not be limited to esoteric interests or research? How can we increase the visibility of content so that awareness is not limited to erratic social media virality but steady accumulation of users? 

2. What are some examples of pushing the limits of fair use? When does activism (such as Aaron Schwartzs') for better copyright laws become necessary and when does it  become unlawful or unethical? 

3. Why was the legacy of the radio and all of the early technological developments obscured from general perception of Silicon Valley? Which companies are analogous to RCA's dominance of the Valley back then? Is there are new 'Silicon Valley' that will slowly establish itself in the next decade or so?
