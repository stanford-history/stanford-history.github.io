1. What type of historical documents / data might present unique challenges when it comes to topic modeling?

2. What other forms of NLP might be beneficial to historians? What types of information would be useful to quickly glean from a text using computation?

3. One apparent issue with tools like MALLET and Voyant is that these tools cannot easily extract context. What are some ways that a lack of context might lead us to erroneous or ambiguous results?
