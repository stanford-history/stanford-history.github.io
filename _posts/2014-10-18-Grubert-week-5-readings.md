Spatial analysis in history does seem to be a valuable contribution to historical scholarship, although spatial history is not a new concept (see, for example, “The Spatial Turn in History”). It seems that enabling historians to use digital spatial tools is a great step forward—along with the digital tools available in many other realms, the ability to quickly produce nice-looking maps is a relevant and useful tool. But it does seem that many people have been analyzing historical events spatially for a long time—whether they have been naming that practice “history” or something else. Human geography as a field springs to mind. I am curious how professionals in either field distinguish their work, or whether the line might be unimportant.

I do completely agree that mapping something rather than just saying or writing locations is additive to understanding. It is difficult to understand how landscapes or locales function without looking at a graphical representation. I’m not sure I agree that starting from a map is a fundamentally different approach to history, as it seemed some of our readings were arguing—in the end, a researcher still has to choose a body of work to focus on and then has to decide that perhaps a map is a fruitful line of inquiry. So, in the sense that the analysis is significantly easier and can be applied to significantly more evidence as a result of the evolution of digital tools, there does seem to be a new burst of actually different types of analysis, but I agree with Blevins and others that the fundamental role of the researcher remains.

Spatial analysis is a large part of the work I intend to do. In particular, since I look at how societal priorities for various environmental and social attributes affect decision making, it is a major line of inquiry for me whether those societal priorities differ dramatically over space (and time!) and if so, why. From a research angle, spatial analysis figures into my work in my choice of case studies, comparative analyses, and other work. Mapping in particular could be important for me, as I hypothesize that proximity to large industrial infrastructure affects the way people feel about the environment. For example, one of my case studies will focus on the development of two major solar thermal power plants, one in a very visible location along an Interstate between Las Vegas and Los Angeles, and the other in a very remote region that very few people will ever pass through. I hope to demonstrate that my methods are robust enough to suppress the visibility effect but not the location effect. To that end, I will also be analyzing oil development that has proceeded somewhat similarly visibly in North Dakota and in South Texas, with the goal of discovering whether cultural and/or landscape (or perhaps landscape through culture?) differences affect societal priorities for protections.

Here is a picture of one of the power plants I look at in my research. I think it is pretty sweet. (Picture by Emily Grubert, January 2014.)
