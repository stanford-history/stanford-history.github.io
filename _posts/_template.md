We are using the writing syntax [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and the platform of [Github](http://github.com) for our course blog this quarter. To write posts that Jekyll and Github will automatically generate, you'll need to ensure two things:

1. The metadata information above -- that which appears between the three dashes -- is called a [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) block. The YAML metadata *must* include, at a minimum, the information above. The `layout` should always remain `post`. Please fill out the remainder of the metadata as needed. You can simply copy and paste the information here into your new post.
2. Jekyll expects post filenames to appear in this format: `2014-09-24-title-of-post.md`. In other words, when you fill out the file name for this post, it *must* begin with YEAR-MONTH-DAY, followed by the title with spaces replaced by dashes. These titles can be as short as you would like, as long as they are unique from other filenames. In other words, if you have a longer title, don't feel as though you must fill out the entire title in the filename; you can save that for the `title` in the YAML block. 

Once you finish writing your post, down below you will find the `Commit new file` button. Fill out the single-line description to explain what you are committing -- these can be as short or as detailed as you would like (e.g., "Committing my post on digital archives for week 2").

You'll notice that when viewing Markdown files on Github, the file is styled and formatted -- you won't see the YAML block, for example, other than as a formatted table. To view the raw Markdown, click the "Raw" button in the upper right side of the file.
