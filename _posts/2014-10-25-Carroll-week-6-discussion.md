1) From the Scott Weingart post: "The ability to cut away just enough data to make the network manageable, but not enough to lose information, is as much an art as it is a science." Having worked with graphs in the field of computer science, I know that he's absolutely right: sparse graphs are much more useful than dense graphs. When is it OK to cut data, and when is it not? Can we establish any general principles?

2) I thought that comparing Paul Revere to a particular type of graph node, a "short cut," was a really brilliant metaphor. It allowed me to conceive of Paul Revere in an entirely different light. What are the advantages and disadvantages of comparing people to mathematical objects? Are mathematical objects well-suited or ill-suited to metaphor?

3) One thing I found a bit annoying about the Republic of Letters project (which on the whole I really like) is that it seems to assign every letter equal importance. The contents of the letter are stripped away, and all we're left with is the metadata. A sentence that Voltaire jotted off to his cobbler is assigned equal importance to the 10-page letter he sent to one of his contemporaries in Germany. Is there any way to fix this?
