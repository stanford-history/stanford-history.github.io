1) A couple of the readings mentioned "The Production of Space" by Henri Lefebrvre, which apparently introduced the concepts of "spatial practice," "representations of space," and "representational space." Does anyone understand the difference between these concepts? Or, moreover, why these distinctions are important? If so, please tell me.

2) Should the goal of a spatial history be to allow the reader to visualize to past, or to provide evidence for a particular narrative of the past? Is one goal better than the other?

3) Last week, we talked a lot about the pitfalls of relying too much on automated text-processing facilities. Are there any pitfalls to spatial history? Can spatial history seem more "true" than it actually is?
