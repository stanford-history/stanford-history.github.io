I chose to create two historical geolocated maps on Google Earth using two maps from the David Rumsey collection: one of North America and one of San Francisco. I thought working with maps that had two significantly different scales would be an interesting exercise. The first map I chose was a 1907 map of North American entitled "North America - General Commercial Chart", which includes ample information trade routes and commercial, as well as information on the vegetation of the continent.

I found this map much more difficult to geo-rectify than the map of San Francisco, and it seems reasonable to assume that it is easier to geo-rectify smaller areas. I would definitely surmise that a historical city map is more likely to be consistent in its accuracy across the entire map area than a continental map, and thus easier to use as an image overlay in Google Earth. The second map I chose was an illustrated pictorial map of San Francisco from 1927. Although I could not flawlessly geo-rectify this map I was able to get a fairly accurate placement. This was a fun map to work with because of its beautiful illustrations, and it was fun to see illustrations of locations like Twin Peaks and Golden Gate Park matched onto the Google Earth geography.

I think there are a lot of possible ways in which spatial history could be used in our projects on the Silicon Valley. One project I have considered is mapping out a genealogy of Silicon Valley companies. I think it could be very interesting to look at the evolution of the valleys many "spinoff" companies in spatial terms to see how that evolution has changed the valley's industrial / corporate geography. I'm definitely excited to look at some of my possible research topics through a geographical / spatial lens to see if any spatial history tools might useful in my final project.
