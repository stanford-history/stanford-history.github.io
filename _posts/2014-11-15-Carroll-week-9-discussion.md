At the moment, I think the possibilities for exciting digital history research are fairly limited. By "exciting," I mean, research that has the potential to be just as thought-provoking as traditional humanities research. I think that some projects in the digital humanities reach or exceed this bar, but the majority do not.

The reason, I think, is that at this point of time, computers still lack sophisticated ways of analyzing texts. As historians, most of our time is spent mining texts for clues about what the past was like. Humans, especially trained humans, do this work much better than computers; and so the insights that humans have and the conclusions that they reach tend to be truer and more thought-provoking. Now, if computers were to become much better at mining and analyzing texts--and I certainly think that this is possible, given advances in artificial intelligence--then digital humanities would break wide open as a field.

This is not to say that digital humanities never produce interesting results. Sometimes they certainly do. I've been very impressed by some of the papers that we've read in this class: the Paul Revere paper, the 18th century books presentation. So digital historians shouldn't throw up their hands in despair. They should just be aware that what they're attempting to do is very difficult.

The best approach for a digital historian in 2014 is to be a "centaur": to analyze in tandem with a computer. A computer has the ability to make crude observations about massive amounts of data; a human has the ability to make sophisticated observations about small amounts of data. Surely these skills are complementary, and we will be better historians together than apart. Computers are really good at generating counterintuitive research questions, which humans can then answer. Many of the techniques that we've learned in this class seem to be good at generating questions. Surely we can use this to our advantage.
