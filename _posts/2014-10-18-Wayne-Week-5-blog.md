 Here's SF in 1915: [Image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0hrszujinyqgafn/Screenshot%202014-10-18%2016.50.36.png?dl=0)
 
 
It's pretty neat seeing the similarities and differences of a place nearly 100 years apart. Time may fly but changes on the good earth are
a gradual process. I zoomed onto this partiuclar portion of the map because this is where the current Caltrain station of SF is. 
This is the entry point that I always go through whenever I visit SF. 
Back then, the railways were used for freight near the port. It's interesting how it has today become one of the gateways to 
San Francisco. 

I found some other interesting maps while browsing the web. 

Here's one of Silicon Valley companies in 2009:

It's interesting seeing the differences in the companies. Additionally, I think these maps are a bit inaccurate location-wise (just look at where
Menlo Park is), but it's still a cool visual of all the companies around the area. 

An interesting spatial history project would be mapping out all of the companies around the area and seeing when companeis come about, when they leave,
and how the geography of where these companies are in the Valley say something about the company itself.
