I was impressed by Open Refine. I found it very easy to navigate and clean the data set.

I've worked quite a bit with SQL, XML, JSON, and similar database-y structures, and high performance in these structures really does rely on clean data. If the data isn't clean, many of the essential SQL functionalities just won't work--assuming that you're able to input your messy data into SQL at all. I guess it would be possible to do some limited data cleaning in SQL, but it wouldn't be as easy. Although I've done some work in the past with already-clean data, I've never had to clean my own data before, so this is an intimidating and fascinating prospect.

Someone commented on how they thought the OpenRefine interface looked dated, and I have to say, I find this surprising. I thought it looked pretty good, and I found it very easy to use. Perhaps this is because I do so much of my work from the command line, which is a UI nightmare. Just having a graphical UI is a dream come true. I actually think that historical tools tend to have good UIs, if for no other reason than because historians couldn't figure out how to use them otherwise. The UIs in computer science are much less friendly.

Anyway, I liked Open Refine, and I hope I get a chance to use it in my project.
