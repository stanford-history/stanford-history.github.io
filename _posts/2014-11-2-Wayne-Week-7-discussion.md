1. Is there a metric to measure when enough is enough? How do we know when we've put in too much information versus when we've put in just enough or too litte? 

2. Is a picture really worth a thousand words or are there nuances in text that no map can convey? Vice versa, what are the benefits of having a map instead of text? 

3. What will the future of digital history be with the advent of VR? Is it necessary even to have text when one can perhaps simply record someone speaking while a user is submerged into a virtual playground of the actual time and place of a topic?
