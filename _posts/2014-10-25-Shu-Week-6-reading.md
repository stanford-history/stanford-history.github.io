# Week 5 Readings

### Networks and Humanities

Reading about networks from Weingart reminded me of the cautions of topic modeling and how it can often be misused.
It seemed that network analysis for humanities can be dangerous for similar reasons. Because there are underlying assumptions in the algorithms made for computer scientists that aren't able to factor in the nuances that's in the humanities, network analysis can often be applied for the wrong reasons.

For example, in terms of edges or relations, it's not a binary relation of "yes or no" that the . Relations are in a continuum, but for the sake of visualization, simplifications must be made in the data.This could take out some of the nuance found in the real world where there in fact isn't complete lack of connections.
I find these types of points to be interesting because they lead us to think at a meta level what we are trying to accomplish with the methods we're learning about.

Even with these cautions, network analysis is an interesting way to learn about history, especially *if* these visualizations can add something fundamental to our historical knowledge or understanding

I enjoyed the Kindred Britain site, but probably mostly for its stories. I just finished reading Frankenstein so reading more about the relations in Mary Shelley's family and how it affected the novel's grim deaths was interesting.

The author of the article on Frankenstein talks more about how the novel itself took a shape of its own, becoming analogous to the Frankenstein monster that is out of control from what its original intent was. Then, the author makes such an interesting point:

"On a far more modest scale, that is a bit like what I feel has happened with my own “wretch”, Kindred Britain."

Kindred Britain looks really cool: but it seems hard to understand where it's going at times because of its sheer breadth and depth on all these issues. Seeing this sense of self-awareness of nice.

It was cool, nonetheless, seeing some things highlight and connect with each other and they made some of his points in his article more pronounced. But as our fellow classmate said:

"I’m not sure I learned anything from this visualization, but it was certanly[sic] cool." -Paul Carroll

### Thoughts about the Valley

The most interesting article for me was the one about Silicon Valley networks.
The part about how the Shockley's  traitorous eight went on to influence much of the Valley reminded me of the modern day's PayPal Mafia and how they went on to create many other companies around the Valley as well.

Reading about the history of how Venture Capital firms formed and how their tight and loose networks helped spur growth in the Valley gave me a more intimate knowledge of how important these networks were for creating Silicon Valley.
I liked how it looked holistically at how different industries such as finance and law and accounting also affected the area and how they were distinguished from other areas. These days, you hear mainly about how important technology for the Valley, but there seems to be silence on how other institutions are also helping the Valley flourish.

I saw that there were graphs in the reading as well. But again, I thought these graphs were more secondary and just supplementary rather than the main meat of what the article was talking about. Which, of course, is fine. But to me, it seems like the network analysis part just simply comes from insightful thinking and observation.
