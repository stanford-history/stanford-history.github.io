Digital historical methods can help supplement the traditional methods of historians. As students and scholars in the Fall 2014 course Digital History at Stanford University, we are creating this site to showcase digital history methods, sample data sets of Silicon Valley's history, and share our thoughts about the readings, methods, techniques, and issues discussed in class.

## Acknowledgements

The site was built by [Jason A. Heppler](http://jasonheppler.org) and six graduate and undergraduate students at Stanford University during the Fall 2014 quarter. Please send questions to jheppler@stanford.edu, or comment and open issues on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stanford-history/stanford-history.github.io).
